This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenCVS[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, and
replacements for OpenBSD library functions that are (regrettably)
absent from other unices. This port has been best tested on Linux only
for now.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

Please send bug reports and patches to chl@tuxfamily.org, so I could
check if it comes from the port or from the original OpenCVS. Code
contribution are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD style
guidelines[1].
